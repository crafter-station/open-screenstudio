# Security Policy

## Our Commitment

Open ScreenStudio takes security seriously. Screen recordings often contain sensitive information, and we're committed to protecting our users.

## Security Principles

### Local-First Processing

- All recording and processing happens on your device
- No data is sent to external servers without explicit user action
- No telemetry or analytics without opt-in consent

### Minimal Permissions

We request only the permissions necessary for functionality:

- **Screen Recording** - Required to capture your screen
- **Microphone** - Only if you want to record audio
- **Camera** - Only if you want webcam overlay
- **File System** - To save your recordings

### No Hidden Features

- Open source code means you can audit everything
- No tracking, no analytics, no phone-home functionality
- What you see is what you get

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters (unless they prefer anonymity).

## Best Practices for Users
