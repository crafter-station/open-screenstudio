## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

**Great bug reports include:**
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Screenshots or screen recordings if applicable
- Your operating system and version
- Any relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

We love feature suggestions! Before creating a feature request:

1. Check if it's already been suggested in [Issues](https://github.com/crafter-station/open-screenstudio/issues)
2. Consider if it fits the project's scope and goals
3. Provide as much detail as possible about the use case

**Great feature requests include:**
- A clear description of the problem you're trying to solve
- How you envision the solution working
- Any alternatives you've considered
- Why this would benefit other users

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged:

- `good first issue` - Simple issues perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Issues where we'd especially appreciate help

**Before you start coding:**

1. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
2. Ask questions if anything is unclear
3. Break large changes into smaller, reviewable chunks

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create an issue first** (if one doesn't exist) to discuss the change
2. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
3. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Update documentation** if needed

### Submitting Your PR

1. Fill out the pull request template completely
2. Link to the related issue(s)
3. Describe what changed and why
4. Include screenshots for UI changes
5. Keep the PR focused - one feature or fix per PR

### After Submitting

- Respond to review feedback promptly
- Make requested changes in new commits (don't force-push during review)
- Be patient - maintainers review PRs as time allows

### PR Review Criteria

Your PR will be reviewed for:

- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Code quality**: Is it readable and maintainable?
- **Testing**: Are there appropriate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is it properly documented?
- **Scope**: Does it stay focused on one thing?

## Style Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Write clear, meaningful commit messages:

```
Good:
- Add automatic zoom detection for click events
- Fix audio sync issue on Windows
- Update README with installation instructions

Bad:
- Fixed stuff
- WIP
- asdfasdf
```

**Format:**
```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body with more details>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Code Style

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable/function names
- Comment complex logic, not obvious code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors gracefully

*Detailed code style guidelines will be added as the tech stack is finalized.*
