# Open ScreenStudio

**Beautiful screen recordings, made simple. Open source.**

Open ScreenStudio is a free, open-source screen recording application that automatically makes your recordings look professional. Record your screen, and let the software handle the magic - automatic zoom effects, smooth cursor movements, and beautiful styling.

> Inspired by [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio), we're building an open alternative that everyone can use, modify, and improve.

## Why Open ScreenStudio?

### The Problem

Creating professional-looking screen recordings is hard. You either:

1. **Record raw footage** that looks amateur - shaky cursor, no focus, boring to watch
2. **Spend hours editing** in complex video software to add zoom effects and polish
3. **Pay for expensive tools** that lock you into subscriptions

Content creators, developers, educators, and product teams all face this dilemma.

### The Solution

Open ScreenStudio automatically transforms your recordings into polished, engaging videos:

- **Record naturally** - just do your thing, we capture everything
- **Automatic magic** - smart zoom follows your actions, cursor moves smoothly
- **Export beautifully** - professional results in minutes, not hours

No video editing skills required. No subscription fees. No vendor lock-in.
